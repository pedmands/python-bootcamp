Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack. If the player and dealer have the same total (not counting blackjacks), this is called a \"push\", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand. Otherwise, the dealer wins."
